        <h4>When you first enroll in Medhelp and during certain times of the year, you can choose how you get your Medhelp coverage. There are 2 main ways to get  Medhelp:  Original Medhelp(Part A and Part B) or a  Medhelp Advantage Plan (Part C). Some people need to get additional coverage, like Medhelp drug coverage or Medhelp Supplement Insurance.</h4> <br><br><br><br>

        <h2>Original Medhelp</h2><hr><br>
        <ul>
        <li>Original Medhelp includes Medhelp Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medical Insurance).</li>
        <li>You can join a separate Medhelp drug plan to get Medhelp drug coverage (Part D).</li>
        <li>You can use any doctor or hospital that takes Medhelp, anywhere in the U.S.</li>
        <li>To help pay your out-of-pocket costs in Original Medhelp (like your 20% coinsurance), you can also shop for and buy supplemental coverage.</li>
        </ul><br><br><br><br>


        <h2>Medhelp Advantage (also known as Part C)</h2><hr><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Medhelp Advantage is a Medhelp-approved plan from a private company that offers an alternative to Original Medihelp for your health and drug coverage. These “bundled” plans include Part A, Part B, and usually Part D.</li>
            <li>In most cases, you’ll need to use doctors who are in the plan’s network.</li>
            <li>Plans may have lower out-of-pocket costs than Original Medihelp.</li>
            <li>Plans may offer some extra benefits that Original Medhelp doesn’t cover—like vision, hearing, and dental services.</li>
        </ul>
